User Stories and acceptance criteria

--------------------
User Story
AS A USER, I WANT TO read in a data file of fencers, SO THAT I CAN assign pools

Points: 3

Task
- Read in a cvs file (1 point) [input command]
- Parse read in cvs file (1 point) [look for 3rd party lib]
- Move parsed data to data structure (2 points) [tuple]

User Benefit
Very high, deal breaker if not done- Needed to get to basic level of implementation

--------------------
User Story
AS A USER, I WANT TO get a list of pools, SO THAT I CAN know who belongs to what team

Point: 16

Acceptance criteria
1. GIVEN a set of pools, WHEN a substract the total members between any given pool THEN the difference must be either less than or equal 1 (difference contraint)

2. GIVEN a set of pools,  WHEN I count the memeber of any pool THEN the count should follow this priority and nothing else (descending order):
a. 6 or 7 fencers
b. 7 or 8 fencers
c. 5 or 6


GIVEN a set of pools, WHEN I look at any pool, THEN fencers in the same club should be even distributed amongst the pools to reduce collusion (while not violating difference contraint)

GIVEN a set of pools, WHEN I compare pools' fencers, THEN each pools should have members of the same skill level, as much as possible (while not violating difference contraint)

--------------------

User Benefit
Very High- Needed to get to intermidiate level of implementation

--------------------
Story: AS A USER, I WANT TO only have between 12 - 100 participants (inclusive), SO THAT I CAN keep the total paricipants to a reasonable size

Point: 2

Task
1. Count number of fencers
2. Validate fencers-count
3. Either give warning and stop or proceed with applicatoon

Acceptance criteria
GIVEN a data set of user, WHEN I get less than 12 fencers, THEN the end-user should be warned and the problem not proceed

GIVEN a data set of user, WHEN I get more than 101 fencers, THEN the end-user should be warned and the problem not proceed

GIVEN a data set of user, WHEN I get between 12 - 100 fencers, THEN the end-user should be proceed without problem


User Benefit
Low.
