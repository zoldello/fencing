Fencing

************
Introduction
************
This code distributes fencers amongst pools. It reads in a file of fencers and outputs on the screen back pools with associated fencers.

Dependencies

Python Version

Python 2.7 is needed to run the code. You can find a video on how to install it on Linux on this video: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vpHfG8E8JI <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vpHfG8E8JI>`_. The windows equivalent can be found on: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiB9mVtKMz0 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiB9mVtKMz0>`_. This code was build on Linux and only tested there. However, it should run find on windows or mac.

Operating System
This was built using Ubuntu. However, since no special library was used, in theory, it should work on Windows or Mac.

============
Usage
============
To run the code directly, run:
**python [PATH]/fencing.py  "[DATA_FILE]"**

Where

- [PATH] is the path of fencing.py
- [DATA_FILE] is a CSV (comma-separated file) contain data on fencers

This assumes you denote *python 2.7 as "python"*. Change it if you use a different denotation.

The project has a data-folder that stores sample data. So, for example, to run that data, you can run:

    **python ./fencing/fencing.py "data/MEconflicts.csv"**

For help run:
    **python ./fencing/fencing.py -h**

If you want an executable, in the code, I created one at:
    **dist/fencing-1.0.0.tar.gz**

The file needs to be uncompressed


This code should work. Contact me at greenish_green@yahoo.com if you have any problem running the code.

Contributor
============
This code was solely developed by me- Philip Adenekan. While I used resources like Pluralsight, bing.com, stackoverflow, YouTube and other common tools, to learn things, I did not ask for nor receive assistance directly from anyone- Everything is solely my work. I have a strong background in JavaScript and in the Microsoft stack. However, that does not mean I cannot quickly pick up a new stack (sometimes in minutes). Many stacks share the same principles, so adjusting is not hard, especially when there is a strong incentive like if successful, I can work with some bright people and researcher.
